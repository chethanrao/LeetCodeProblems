1) A median of a binary tree is defined as the average of elements at [depth/2,breadth/2-1],[depth/2,breadth/2+1] 
if depth of tree is odd 
and
average of the elements at [depth/2-1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2+1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2-1,breadth/2+1] and [depth/2+1,breadth/2+1]
if depth of tree is even.
Given a complete binary tree...find the median?

2) Shortest distance to a rotating target: A car is parked at one corner(left bottom) 
of a matrix and a passenger is at another corner diagnolly opposite(right top) the matrix. 
A car can move up or right .  
The passenger rotates  around a square with side x.

For every move of the car left or up....the passenger moves one block.
Find the shortest time of the car to the passenger?

3) Given a binary tree find sum of all the nodes in the sub tree of a target node.
Given that all values of nodes are unique and there exists a target node with value target node.
int binaryTree(TreeNode node,int targetNode)

4)
Given a binary tree find if sum of any subtree is equal to a given target sum.
If such a sub tree exists return the root of the subtree.
TreeNode binaryTree(TreeNode node,int targetSum)

5) Given a set of rectangles with (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4)
and a range (x5,x6) and (x7,x8) inclusive of the rectangles.
return all the missing vertices of a rectangles in the range (x5,x6) and (x7,x8).

6) If one draws a straight line through points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) and cuts a balanced binary tree. 
   Find the number of nodes in each cut part?
Here node at position (x,y) is at height x from top and at position y from left most node of the tree at that height.
