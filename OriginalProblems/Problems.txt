1) A median of a binary tree is defined as the average of elements at [depth/2,breadth/2-1],[depth/2,breadth/2+1] 
if depth of tree is odd 
and
average of the elements at [depth/2-1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2+1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2-1,breadth/2+1] and [depth/2+1,breadth/2+1]
if depth of tree is even.
Given a complete binary tree...find the median?
