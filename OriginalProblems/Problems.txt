1) A median of a binary tree is defined as the average of elements at [depth/2,breadth/2-1],[depth/2,breadth/2+1] 
if depth of tree is odd 
and
average of the elements at [depth/2-1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2+1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2-1,breadth/2+1] and [depth/2+1,breadth/2+1]
if depth of tree is even.
Given a complete binary tree...find the median?

2) Shortest distance to a moving target: A car is parked at one corner(left bottom) 
of a matrix and a passenger is at another corner diagnolly opposite(right top) the matrix. 
A car can move up or right . The passenger can move down or left. 
The passenger moves in a square with one of the sides of length x.
Find the shortest time of the car to the passenger?
